After completing this simulation experiment one should be able to </br>
	Model a given real system to an equivalent simplified model of single degree freedom system with suitable assumptions / idealisations.</br>
	Calculate the natural frequency of undamped oscillation, critical damping constant and critical damping ratio of the proposed single degree freedom system. </br> 
	Study the response of the system for the excitation caused by an unbalanced mass for different rotating frequency of the machine.</br>
	Calculate steady state amplitude, phase angle as a function rotating frequency of the machine.</br>

Forced vibration of single degree of freedom system- Rotating unbalance</h3></br>
<h4>Introduction</h4> </br></br>
Rotating Unbalance is the uneven distribution of mass around an axis of rotation. Unbalance is caused when the centre of mass (inertia axis) is out of alignment</br>
 with the centre of rotation (geometric axis). When an object is forced to spin about a fixed axis, if the mass is not evenly distributed about that fixed axis then a</br> 
 centrifugal force resulted from this unbalance induce an exciting force due to which the structure vibrates. Unbalance in rotating machines is a common source of </br>
 vibration excitation that one sees in everyday life such as vibration of automobile engine or the washing machine.  One might have experienced the effect of vibration</br>
 due to rotating unbalance while driven a car where the wheels are not balanced. At some particular speed the car will shake, sometimes quite violently. At this speed,</br>
 the rotational speed of the wheels is such as to be close to the natural frequency of the car on its suspension, so that the amplitude becomes a maximum. This phenomenal</br>
 is really important because if not dealt with promptly one could have catastrophic failures due to the fatigue caused by the vibration.To study the effect of vibration </br>
 due to rotating unbalance, an unbalanced rotating machine modelled as single degree spring mass damper shown in fig 1 having an equivalent unbalance mass m rotating</br>
 at frequency ? with its centre of gravity at a distance e from the axis of rotation. This results a centrifugal force proportional to the square of frequency of rotation.</br>
 The centrifugal force is the maximum value of sinusoidal excitation in any direction.</br>

The equation of motion in the vertical direction can be written as, </br>
$m\ddot x\overset{}{+c\dot x}+kx=me\omega^2\;\sin\omega t$	... (1)</br>
Where M is the mass of the structure, c is the damping present in the system and k is the stiffness of the system.</br>
Steady state amplitude X and phase angle   due to vibration caused by rotating unbalance is given by,</br>
$\frac{m\omega^2e}{\sqrt{(k-M\omega^2)^2+(c\omega)^2}}$	... (2)</br>
And


 $\phi=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{c\omega}{(k-m\omega^2)}\right)$	... (3)</br>
Equation 2 and 3 written in dimensionless form as,</br>
	 				... (4)</br>


$\phi=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2\varsigma({\displaystyle\frac\omega{\omega_n}})}{(1-({\displaystyle\frac\omega{\omega_n}})^2)}\right)$ 	... (5)</br>

The variation of X/ (me/M) and phase angle   for different value of r and ? shown in Fig 2.</br>

Lets try to understand these equations by doing a few simple simulations, go to next tab procedure to find out how to run the simulation to EXPLORE</br>
 (expR) and to EXPERIMENT (expT). A talking tutorial or a self-running demo with narration can be seen at EXPLAIN (expN).</br>
