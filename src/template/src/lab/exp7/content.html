Slider Crank Mechanism
The slider-crank mechanism is one of the most useful mechanisms in modern technology since it
appears in most of the internal combustion engines including automobiles, trucks and small engines.
The slider-crank kinematic chain consists of four bodies linked with three cylindrical joints and one
sliding or prismatic joint. It is used to change circular into reciprocating motion, or reciprocating into
circular motion.<br>

The arm may be a bent portion of the shaft, or a separate arm attached to it. Attached to the end of
the crank by a pivot is a rod, usually called a connecting rod. The end of the rod attached to the
crank moves in a circular motion, while the other end is usually constrained to move in a linear
Position Analysis

Figure 1 shows a slider-crank mechanism in which the stroke-line of the slider doesn’t pass
through the axis of rotation of the crank. θ3 in clockwise direction from x-axis is taken as
negative.
Then,
equa
Velocity Analysis<br>

<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr4.png"  width="461"><br>


Let ̇ be the velocity of the slider, and ω3 be the angular velocity of the coupler link. Then,
from the data gleaned from the position analysis and the crank velocity, ω2, we have
$$\dot d=\frac{a\omega_2\sin\left(\theta_3-\theta_2\right)}{\cos\left(\theta_3\right)}$$

$$\omega_3=\frac{a\omega_2\cos\left(\theta_2\right)}{\cos\left(\theta_3\right)}$$
Acceleration Analysis<br>

<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr5.png"  width="461"><br>

Differentiating the earlier equations from velocity analysis, we end up with the acceleration
data of the slider crank. With the prior knowledge of the angular acceleration of the crank, α2,
the parameters such as the linear acceleration of the slider, ̈ , and the angular acceleration of
the coupler, α3.
$$
\ddot d=\frac{a\alpha_2\sin\left(\theta_3-\theta_2\right)-a\omega_2^2\cos\left(\theta_3-\theta_2\right)-b\omega_3^2}{\cos\left(\theta_3\right)}


$$

$$\alpha_3=\frac{a\alpha_2\cos\left(\theta_2\right)-a\omega_2^2\sin\left(\theta_2\right)-b\omega_3^2\sin\left(\theta_3\right)}{\cos\left(\theta_3\right)}
$$
Inversions<br>

<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr6.png"  width="461"><br>

Different mechanisms obtained by fixing different links of a kinematics chain are known as its
inversions.
A slider–crank chain has the following inversions: -
1. First inversion (i.e., Reciprocating engine and compressor)
2. Second inversion (i.e., Whitworth quick return mechanism and Rotary engine)
3. Third inversion (i.e., Oscillating cylinder engine and crank & slotted – lever mechanism)
4. Fourth inversion (Hand pump)



First Inversion
In this type of inversion CE is held fixed and A rotates around C along a circle and B slides back and
forth along CE.<br>

<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr7.png"  width="461"><br>


<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr8.png"  width="461"><br>
This is the most common type of inversion. It is used in reciprocating engine and compressor.

Second Inversion
In this type of inversion ‘C’ and ‘A’ are both held fixed and the link CE rotates in a circle
around C. The slider B slides back and forth along the rotating CE.<br>


<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr9.png"  width="461"><br>


Whitworth Quick-Return Mechanism<br>
In this inversion of the slider-crank the slider guide link is made to rotate. This is called a quick-return
mechanism. This linkage also converts rotary motion of the crank into oscillatory angular motion of
the slider guide link. This mechanism is used in shaper machine tools for cutting metals. Joseph
Whitworth was a 19th century British engineer and inventor.<br>

Third Inversion<br>
In this type of inversion A and B are both held fixed but the slider is allowed to swivel.<br>


<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr11.png"  width="461"><br>

<img  height="355" src="../images/poscr12.png"  width="461"><br>
The oscillating cylinder engine is a form of a slider-crank mechanism. This mechanism is used often in door<br>
damper mechanisms. In the 19th century the oscillating cylinder was used on steam locomotives.

Fourth Inversion
In this type of inversion the slider B is held fixed and CE slides back and forth through the slider.<br>
